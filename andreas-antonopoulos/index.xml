Are Hardware Wallets Secure Enough? Q - Hi Andreas. I store my crypto on a Ledger. Listening to Trace Mayer this week has me concerned that this is not safe enough. Trace says you need Bitcoin Core for network validation, Armory for managing the private keys and a Glacier protocol for standard operating procedures and a Purism laptop for hardware.</description></item><item><title>Andreas Antonopoulos Initial Blockchain Download (2018-10-23)</title><link>//btctranscripts.com/andreas-antonopoulos/2018-10-23-andreas-antonopoulos-initial-blockchain-download/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//btctranscripts.com/andreas-antonopoulos/2018-10-23-andreas-antonopoulos-initial-blockchain-download/</guid><description>Andreas Antonopoulos

Schnorr signatures We’re currently using the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) which is a specific way of doing digital signatures with elliptic curves but not the only way.
