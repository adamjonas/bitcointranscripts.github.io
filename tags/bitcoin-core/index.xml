Introduction Alright guys.. take a seat. ((various mumblings)) Want to thank our sponsors, Digital Garage (applause). Second order of business, if you guys could&amp;hellip; trash away.. that would be awesome. There are trash cans in the back and right there and right next to the drinks. So at the end of the night, that would be great.</description></item><item><title>Knowledge Aggregation And Propagation</title><link>//btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/knowledge-aggregation-and-propagation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//btctranscripts.com/cryptoeconomic-systems/2019/knowledge-aggregation-and-propagation/</guid><description>Intro https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1uRy10dBBcxrnzjdUaO2y03f5H34yFlxktOcanvVYE/edit

I&amp;rsquo;ll be the contrarian - I think academia is awful and should be destroyed.
Reputation is completely independent of content and should not be the mechanism by which you judge the quality of research; your reputation is worthless to me. (laughter)
My perspective: [first, slidemaker&amp;rsquo;s regret! might have reorganized this]
I&amp;rsquo;m a bitcoin core developer. Also worked at LedgerX (4 years). I also work on biotech on the hobbyist side, garage engineering &amp;ndash; what I was doing when bitcoin was launched.</description></item><item><title>Sighash Noinput</title><link>//btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/sighash-noinput/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/sighash-noinput/</guid><description>Bryan Bishop

Hi, my name is Bryan, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be talking about SIGHASH NOINPUT. It was something that I was asked to speak about. It is currently not deployed, but it is an active proposal.
So, just really brief about who I am. I have a software development background. I just left LedgerX last week, so that is an exciting change in my life.</description></item><item><title>Wallet Security</title><link>//btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/wallet-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/wallet-security/</guid><description>Bryan Bishop

Alright, I’m now going to talk about bitcoin wallet security. And I was asked to talk about key management and hardware security modules and a bunch of other topics all in one talk. This will be a bit broader than some of the other talks because this is an important subject about how do you actually store bitcoin and then some of the developments around the actual storage of bitcoin in a secure way.</description></item></channel></rss>
