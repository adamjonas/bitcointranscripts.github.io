Warren Togami
https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1137389045355614208
Introduction Today I work at Blockstream but I have a long long history working in open-source software first with the Linux operating system as an advocate then working on the operating system itself. This has led me to a few insights on the defense of bitcoin that has little to do with software but it needs a talk thrown together very quickly for today.</description></item><item><title>Great Consensus Cleanup (2019-06-06)</title><link>//btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06-06-great-consensus-cleanup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2019-06-06-great-consensus-cleanup/</guid><description>2019-06-06

Introduction There&amp;rsquo;s not much new to talk about. Unclear about CODESEPARATOR. You want to make it a consensus rule that transactions can&amp;rsquo;t be larger than 100 kb. No reactions to that? Alright. Fine, we&amp;rsquo;re doing it. Let&amp;rsquo;s do it. Does everyone know what this proposal is?
Validation time for any block&amp;ndash; we were lazy about fixing this. Segwit was a first step to fixing this, by giving people a way to do this in a more efficient way.</description></item><item><title>Greg Maxwell Taproot Pace</title><link>//btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/greg-maxwell-taproot-pace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//btctranscripts.com/greg-maxwell/greg-maxwell-taproot-pace/</guid><description>Name: Greg Maxwell

Is Taproot development moving too fast or too slow? Taproot has been discussed for 2.5 years already and by the time it would activate it will certainly at this point be over three years.
The bulk of the Taproot proposal, other than Taproot itself and specific encoding details, is significantly older too.</description></item><item><title>How To Mine Bitcoin Profitably</title><link>//btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/how-to-mine-bitcoin-profitably/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/montreal-2015/how-to-mine-bitcoin-profitably/</guid><description>How to mine bitcoin profitability

I am going to talk about the scheme I posted to the mailing list yesterday which is to implement MAST (merkleized abstract syntax trees) in bitcoin in a minimally invasive way as possible. It&amp;rsquo;s broken into two major consensus features that together gives us MAST. I&amp;rsquo;ll start with the last BIP.

Demo My project is to create a user interface for lightning that might appeal to a different crowd than ours. We’re kind of used to Linux, open source, free software so being in a proprietary environment like Excel is unfamiliar territory for us.

The idea is that testnet is horribly broken for testing things, especially testing things for long-term. You have large reorgs on testnet. What about testnet with a less broken difficulty adjustment? Testnet is for miner testing really.</description></item><item><title>Socratic Seminar (2020-07-08)</title><link>//btctranscripts.com/chicago-bitdevs/2020-07-08-socratic-seminar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//btctranscripts.com/chicago-bitdevs/2020-07-08-socratic-seminar/</guid><description>Name: Socratic Seminar
