Intro Today Schnorr and Taproot for Lightning, it is a really exciting topic.
Lightning architecture The Lightning architecture for those who are not familiar with it. You have the blockchain as the underlying layer. On top of it you are going to build a channel, you have a HTLC and people are going to spend onions to you.</description></item><item><title>Bip Taproot Bip Tapscript (2019-12-16)</title><link>//btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2019-12-16-bip-taproot-bip-tapscript/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//btctranscripts.com/sf-bitcoin-meetup/2019-12-16-bip-taproot-bip-tapscript/</guid><description>2019-12-16

Please try to find seats. Today we have a special treat. We have Pieter here, who is well known as a contributor to Bitcoin Core, stackexchange, the mailing list, and he has been around forever. He&amp;rsquo;s the author of multiple BIPs. Today he is going to talk about taproot and tapscript which is basically what the whole Schnorr movement thing became.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Script</title><link>//btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/bitcoin-script/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//btctranscripts.com/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/bitcoin-script/</guid><description>Featuring roasbeef

Introduction Alright. Are we ready to get going? Thumbs up? Alright. Cool. I am Andrew and this is David. We&amp;rsquo;re here to talk about blockchain design patterns: layers and scaling approaches. This will be a tour of a bunch of different scaling approaches in bitcoin in particular but it&amp;rsquo;s probably applicable to other blockchains out there. Our talk is in 3 parts.</description></item><item><title>Future Of Privacy Coins</title><link>//btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/future-of-privacy-coins/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//btctranscripts.com/magicalcryptoconference/2019/future-of-privacy-coins/</guid><description>Future of privacy coins

Topic: Is Taproot development moving too fast or too slow?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/hrlpnc/technical_taproot_why_activate/fyqbn8s?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3
Is Taproot development moving too fast or too slow? Taproot has been discussed for 2.5 years already and by the time it would activate it will certainly at this point be over three years.
The bulk of the Taproot proposal, other than Taproot itself and specific encoding details, is significantly older too.</description></item><item><title>Improving Bitcoin Smart Contract Efficiency</title><link>//btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2018/improving-bitcoin-smart-contract-efficiency/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//btctranscripts.com/mit-bitcoin-expo/mit-bitcoin-expo-2018/improving-bitcoin-smart-contract-efficiency/</guid><description>Improving efficiency of smart contracts on the bitcoin network

Introduction I will be talking about discreet log contracts, taproot, and graftroot. Not in that order, the order will actually be taproot, graftroot, and then discreet log contracts.
Quick intro: I&amp;rsquo;m Tadge Dryja. I work here at MIT down the street at Digital Currency Initiative.

John Newbery: Alright, Security Models. This is going to be like a quick whistle-stop tour of various things, very high-level view. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start by giving you some kind of framework to think about things. So in cryptography, we often talk about security proofs in terms of existing schemes, we talk about assumptions.
So, for example&amp;hellip; If you can break new scheme B, then you&amp;rsquo;ll also be able to break old scheme A.</description></item><item><title>Kalle Alm Signet Workshop (2020-02-07)</title><link>//btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-07-kalle-alm-signet-workshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//btctranscripts.com/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-07-kalle-alm-signet-workshop/</guid><description>Name: Kalle Alm

MAST stuff You could directly merkleize scripts if you switch from IF, IFNOT, ELSE with IFJUMP that has the number of bytes.
With graftroot and taproot, you never to do any scripts (which were a hack to get things started). But we&amp;rsquo;re doing validation and computation.
You take every single path it has; so instead, it becomes &amp;hellip; certain condition, or certain not conditions&amp;hellip; You take every possible ifs, you use this, you say it&amp;rsquo;s one of these, then you specify which one, and you show it and everyone else can validate this.</description></item><item><title>Notes</title><link>//btctranscripts.com/bitcoinops/schnorr-taproot-workshop-2019/notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//btctranscripts.com/bitcoinops/schnorr-taproot-workshop-2019/notes/</guid><description>Schnorr and taproot workshop 2019 NYC

Why Schnorr and why taproot? Who here already feels comfortbale with Schnorr/Taproot? This is a proposed consensus change to bitcoin. When we talk about consensus changes, we often talk about tradeoffs and compromises. It would be irresponsible to say taproot has no downsides, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to mention it&amp;rsquo;s a clear win for bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Secure Protocols Bip Taproot</title><link>//btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/secure-protocols-bip-taproot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//btctranscripts.com/breaking-bitcoin/2019/secure-protocols-bip-taproot/</guid><description>Secure protocols on BIP-taproot

Introduction I am going to tlak about something that is a collaboration of many people in the bitcoin community including my colleagues at Blockstream. The bip-taproot proposal was recently posted to the bitcoin-dev mailing list which proposes an improvement for bitcoin.

Introduction Alrighty, let&amp;rsquo;s get started. Gather around. Phil could use some company here. Nobody likes the front row. Maybe the benches. So I have a little different format for how I want to do it this week. Usually I cover a broad series of topics that I steal from the New York&amp;rsquo;s meetup list. Going through that, I thought there was something that looked interesting which was the new taproot proposals that were finally posted by Pieter Wuille.</description></item><item><title>Socratic Seminar Signet (2020-08-19)</title><link>//btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-08-19-socratic-seminar-signet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2020-08-19-socratic-seminar-signet/</guid><description>Name: Socratic Seminar
